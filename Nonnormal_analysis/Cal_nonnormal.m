%% European Power Grid Non-Normality Analysis
%
% This code implements an analysis of the non-normality of the European
% transmission grid, based on a linearized model derived from the dataset
% `EUR_2025.mat`. The study focuses on high-renewable penetration scenarios,
% with emphasis on Iberian system dynamics.
%
% The workflow includes:
%   - Building the extended system matrix from the aggregated model
%   - Constructing the symmetric (Hermitian) component of the system matrix
%   - Quantifying non-normality via the difference between Hermitian and
%     non-Hermitian dominant eigenvalues
%   - Sorting and visualizing nonnormality across buses to identify the most
%     sensitive nodes under varying inertia conditions
%
% This framework supports:
%   - Stability assessment in high-renewable scenarios
%   - Evaluation of inertia-related vulnerability in interconnected grids
%   - Informed design of damping and control strategies
%
